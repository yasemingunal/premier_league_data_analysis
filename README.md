# premier_league_data_analysis

For this project, one goal was to analyze different variables that could potentially impact the outcomes of matches throughout the 2020-2021 season. Specifically, I wanted to study whether or not the total average age of a club, the total number of yellow cards the club received, or the total number of successful passes has an evident impact on the number of wins that a team experiences during a given season. 
Another goal of mine for this project was to analyze the performance of specific positions and how they might impact the outcome of matches. First I looked at the defensive line of each club; I wanted to measure whether or not aggression played a role in the number of goals conceded. To achieve this, I compared the total number of yellow cards each defensive line of each club received with the number of goals that club conceded for the season. As for the midfielders, I wanted to measure if there was a correlation between the number of assists or goals midfielders had for each team and the number of wins that team experienced. Lastly, I wanted to analyze the offensive line’s performance in relation to their salaries. To accomplish this, I compared their salaries to the number of goals they scored and the number of matches they played during the season to determine the extent to which an offensive player’s performance has an impact on their yearly salary.
Lastly, I wanted to leverage the data to calculate the probability of the home and away teams winning a match based on the half-time score of the match. If this yields significant disparities in the probabilities, then this insight could be used for predicting the outcome of future matches based on their half-time scores.
